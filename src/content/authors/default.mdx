Passionate about software and everything related to it. 

Why did I create this blog? The answer is simple: Knowledge isn't just for meâ€”it's for everyone. This blog is a way for me to store what I learn, and if you find it useful, feel free to take advantage of it ^^.

I've created my own blog before, but I realized my design skills are lacking. That's why I've chosen to use an Astro template to save time and focus on content.

I hope you find it useful. Don't be hesitate to connect with me!
